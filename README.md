# Missionaries-and-Cannibals-
# Description
This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" problem, written in Python. The objective of the game is to safely transport all the missionaries and cannibals from one side of the river to the other using a boat while following these rules:

The boat can carry at most two people at a time.
There cannot be more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river (if there are missionaries present), or the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
# Game Rules
You can move 1 or 2 people at a time in the boat.
After every move, the number of missionaries must not be less than the number of cannibals on either side of the river.
# The game ends when:
You successfully move all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to the other side of the river (YOU WIN).
The cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river (YOU LOSE).
